# Demo: todo-basic

[![StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz_small.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/wallace-js/wallace/tree/master/examples/todo-basic)

This demo showcases a simple TODO list which lets you add tasks and check them off.

It sets up reactive behaviour by using `watch` in the overridden render method.
